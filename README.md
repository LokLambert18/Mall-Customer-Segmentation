Clustering is one of the most common ways to explore data and to get a clear
understanding of its structure. This can be characterized as a task of finding subgroups in
a complete dataset. Similar data will be grouped into the same subgroup. A cluster refers
to a collection of aggregated data points because of some similarities. Clustering is used in
market basket analysis to segment customers based on customer behavior.

K means clustering algorithm is applied which partitions the dataset into ‘k’ different number
of clusters that are non-overlapping and each data point belongs to only one sub-group
which has similar properties. It is a centroid-based algorithm in which each cluster is
associated with a centroid. The main idea is to reduce the distance between the data
points and their respective cluster centroid

The algorithm takes raw unlabelled data as input and divides the dataset into clusters and
the process is repeated until the best clusters are found. We use PCA, a linear
dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the data dimensionality by maximizing the
variance. t-SNE, a non-linear technique is used for exploration.
